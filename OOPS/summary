Summary
​​​​​​​So far you have learnt that:

OOP is a style of programming which allows to club data and behavior together

OOP is more suited for coding real life scenarios

Objects are real world entities

Classes are logical entities and are used for classification.

Class is a description of attributes and behavior that objects of that classification should possess

Common attributes are created using a special method called __init__

Objects can be created using ClassName() or using object literals for the built in classes

Attributes are created using the syntax, reference_variable.attribute_name = value

Behavior is created by defining a function inside the class having a special parameter called self.


--Inheritance : Ability of a class to inherit the properties and methods from its parent class
--Polyphorphism : Ability of an object to take different forms or behavior based on the context
--Abstraction : Represnting essential features and hiding unnessary details to simplfy the complexity
--Encapsulation: Building data and methods that operate on a data within a single unit(class)
