--Stack

A stack is a linear data structure in which elements can be inserted and deleted only from one side of the list, called the top. A stack follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle, i.e., the element inserted at the last is the first element to come out.

Stack is an object to store the data in a very specific way. The alternative name for a stack (but only in IT terminology) is LIFO.

--Operations possible on the stack are:

 Push or insert an element to the top of the stack
 Pop or remove an element from top of the stack
